# TF-IDF

This is one of our Natural Language Processing course assignment

This assignment is a sentiment analysis project about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015. Our main goal in our project is to make our dataset meaningful and apply Natural Language Processing and TF-IDF to the given sentences, to understand whether users are making positive, negative or neutral comments about the airlines, and to make it ready for test sets for the future.
